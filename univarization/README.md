## Inside 

- Sumcheck implmentation (non-ZK)
- MiniSpartan based on Sumcheck (non-ZK)
- Multi-linear polymonial over integer domain
- Univariate polynomial over \mathbb{H} domain and integer domain
- Multi-variate PCS => Univariate PCS
    - Gemini: tensor-product argument
    - Logup+ ([PH23]): Section 5.

## TODOs

- unipoly coeffs should be [f0, f1, ..., fn]
- more comments 
- protocol description
- clean up the space
- towards zeromorph
- batch kzg10 proofs
- reduce number of openings by linearizing commitments
- shift over hypercube as in hyperplonk
    - find primitive polynomial
    - linearization by mle
- shift over pyramid-like subgroups ([PH23])
- add zk
- realize kzg10
